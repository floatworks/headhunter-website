          <h2>About</h2>
           <p>Sarah Cavendish was established in 1995 to cater for the ever increasing need for fast and efficient search and
		selection consultants and outstanding complimentary advisory services. We have made it our
		business to understand the social and financial issues that face your business on a daily basis and
		have developed a clear strategy to deliver results.</p>		   
		   <p>Unlike other consultants we are not based in any location and prefer to keep our consultants moving
		around Europe, the Middle East and Asia to ensure they regularly engage with the type of individuals
		you are consistently looking for and stay ahead of the curve. They are also better placed to maintain
		memberships to societies and organisations that will compliment the search and selection process.</p>
		   <p>Unlike other consultants are team is required to complete their own research to ensure they fully
		understand each level of the engagement. We do not allow them to pass this crucial part of the
		process to a more junior member of staff.</p>
		   <p>At Sarah Cavendish we never allow our consultants to handle more than three engagements at any one time to
		ensure each of our consultants is focused to find you high performing individuals through hard work
		and diligence, rather than luck... every time!</p>
		   <p>Without the need for expensive office and reception overheads, Sarah Cavendish offer industry leading
		introduction rates from as low as 5% to a maximum of 15% depending on the engagement level.
		Working purely through interactive media and point to point technologies you will find our team
		always ready to help. Contact us by email and weâ€™ll make it easy to stay in contact.</p>
