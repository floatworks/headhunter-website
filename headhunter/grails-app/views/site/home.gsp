            <h2>About Us</h2>

            <p>Sarah Cavendish was established in 1995 to cater for the ever increasing need for fast and efficient search and
            selection consultants and outstanding complimentary advisory services. We have made it our
            business to understand the social and financial issues that face your business on a daily basis and
            have developed a clear strategy to deliver results.</p>

            <p>Unlike other consultants we are not based in any location and prefer to keep our consultants moving
            around Europe, the Middle East and Asia to ensure they regularly engage with the type of individuals
            you are consistently looking for and stay ahead of the curve. They are also better placed to maintain
            memberships to societies and organisations that will compliment the search and selection process.</p>

            <p>Unlike other consultants are team is required to complete their own research to ensure they fully
            understand each level of the engagement. We do not allow them to pass this crucial part of the
            process to a more junior member of staff.</p>

            <p>At Sarah Cavendish we never allow our consultants to handle more than three engagements at any one time to
            ensure each of our consultants is focused to find you high performing individuals through hard work
            and diligence, rather than luck... every time!</p>

            <p>Without the need for expensive office and reception overheads, Sarah Cavendish offer industry leading
            introduction rates from as low as 5% to a maximum of 15% depending on the engagement level.
            Working purely through interactive media and point to point technologies you will find our team
            always ready to help. Contact us by email and weâ€™ll make it easy to stay in contact.</p>
