	  <p>We pride ourselves on maintaining contact with individuals who can quickly make a difference.  Introduced on a daily rate these individuals are motivated and highly skilled business professionals.  We look to negotiate a competitive rate for both parties, but as we have minimal overheads our compensation is always the smallest part.
